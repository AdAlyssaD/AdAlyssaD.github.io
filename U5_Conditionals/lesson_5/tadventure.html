        You approach a forest, looking for your grandmother's house. However, when on the way towards the forest you've lost the map you have. So, you end up having to guess throughout the forest which way you're supposed ot go. Ahead of you, theres a mountain you could climb, or a lake that seems to lead around the cliff, despite being closed in. Do you, (1) climb the mountain or (2) swim around it. Please press 1 for climb, and 2 for swim.
